## Your turn : StringAndBinaries-4

**(Hard)** 
Write a function that takes a single-quoted string of the form number `[+-*/]` number and returns the result of the calculation. The individual numbers do not have leading plus or minus signs.

`calculate('123 + 27') # => 150`

## My implementation
```elixir
# Too hard for me :)
```
